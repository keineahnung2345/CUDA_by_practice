## write-combined memory
[What is write combined memory?](https://www.quora.com/What-is-write-combined-memory)
```
Write combining (WC) is a computer bus technique for allowing data to be combined and temporarily stored 
in a buffer — the write combine buffer (WCB) — to be released together later in burst mode instead of 
writing (immediately) as single bits or small chunks.
